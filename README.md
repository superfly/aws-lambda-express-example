# Fly.io - AWS Lambda Example

This is a simple example demonstrating AWS Lambda. It applies an `express.js` web server and prints out the HTTP Method, path, and headers from the view. `Claudia.js` is used to scaffold the project on AWS from the command line. You can see the end Fly-served result by clicking [this link](https://aws-lambda-example.fly.io/).

For more information on how you can setup AWS Lambda on the Fly Application Delivery Network, browse the [documentation](https://fly.io/docs/guides/#mounting-aws-lambda).
